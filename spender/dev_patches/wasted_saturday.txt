    PCI/x86: detect host bridge config space size w/o using quirks
    
    Many host bridges support a 4k config space, so check them directy
    instead of using quirks to add them.
    
    We only need to do this extra check for host bridges at this point,
    because only host bridges are known to have extended address space
    without also having a PCI-X/PCI-E caps.  Other devices with this
    property could be done with quirks (if there are any).
    
    As a bonus, we can remove the quirks for AMD host bridges with family
    10h and 11h since they're not needed any more.
    
    With this patch, we can get correct pci cfg size of new Intel CPUs/IOHs
    with host bridges.
