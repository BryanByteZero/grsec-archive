  	|   Today I will be thoroughly dissecting a fascinating bug
	|   discovered by someone else (one of those awful whitehats,
	|   what with their disclosure and other such unethical acts).
	|   Read on for my groundbreaking analysis, praised by
	|   infosec pseudo-intellectuals that confuse code-dumps and
	|   unnecessary verbosity with useful insight!
	|___________

	0:	/* This is a hello world application! */
	1:	#include <stdio.h>
	2:
	3:	int main(void)
	4:	{
	5:		int i = 0;
	6:
	7:		/* here we will repeat a comment verbatim
	8:		   with no understanding of the underlying code
	9:		*/
	10:		printf("HELLO WORLD! %d\n", ++i);
	11:		/* we printed 0, now return! */
	12:		return 0;
	13:	}
  
 	----------------------------------------------------------------
	|   Obviously, as we can see on line 0, this is a hello world 
	|   application.  Before I get too deep into this incredibly
	|   thoughtful analysis, an off-topic comment: whitehat who
	|   published this bug: you have just made some very serious
	|   enemies, whether you know it or not.  Guys like ret that
	|   post comments on each popular post of mine, regardless of
	|   the fact that 70% of my content is inaccurate!  Anyway,
	|   back to the analysis!
	|
	|   Obviously on line 3 we have the main function being declared,
	|   which obviously is obviously the main function of the hello
	|   world application, whose purpose is to print out a hello 
	|   world message.  Now we really get to the meat of this 
	|   function on line 5 where the signed integer variable i is 
	|   initialized with the constant value 0.  Obviously on line 7 we
	|   can easily see that there is a comment that I will repeat 
	|   verbatim with no understanding of the underlying code, but 
	|   as long as I substitute some of the words with words of my 
	|   own, the people who praise my blog, who never actually read 
	|   it but just see a wall of text and talk about it to their 
	|   friends, calling it 'interesting' or other descriptive 
	|   terms, because it demonstrates strong security knowledge 
	|   and code understanding, will never know the difference.

	0:	/* This is a hello world application! */
	1:	#include <stdio.h>
	2:
	3:	int main(void)
	4:	{
	5:		int i = 0;
	6:
	7:		/* this is the same exact code but no one will
	7:		   notice, because you're not really reading this
	8:		   anyway. you're just thinking: "this would make
	8:		   me look cool if i retweeted it to my friends!"
	9:		*/
	10:		printf("HELLO WORLD! %d\n", ++i);
	11:		/* we printed 0, now return! */
	12:		return 0;
	13:	}
	
 	----------------------------------------------------------------
	|
	|   Now things start to get really interesting on line 10, where
	|   obviously we can easily see, obviously, that "Hello worlld!!!"
	|   is printed along with the value of the signed integer i, which
	|   is zero.  This is confirmed on the following line, which means
	|   that we have just printed the value zero and now we are 
	|   returning from the main function.  The obvious part here is 
	|   that upon returning from this function, the application 
	|   instantly exits with the exit code of zero, which obviously
	|   we can see on line 12.
	|
	|   Now to wrap things up, on line 13 we have the closing brace
	|   for the main function which took no arguments and returned 
	|   an integer with the value of zero.  It had one local 
	|   variable named i, which was initialized to the value of zero
	|   and then was printed out with the string "pwnie please!"
	|   And there you have it!
	|
	|   PS: whitehat that reported this bug, I know I said this 
	|   already before, but I want to say it again here because it 
	|   makes me look like more of a gangster and increases my scene
	|   cred without having to actually contribute anything useful,
	|   but you're making a lot of serious enemies, super serious.
	|   Seriously, they're really serious, and you should seriously
	|   be afraid and probably stop releasing vulnerabilities so that
	|   I can not publicize them with my in-depth writeups for fame.
	|
	|   Join me next time where I'll talk about some innovative 
	|   research into remote stack overflows which amounts to what
	|   was already well-discussed in 2001-2003, where I'll claim
	|   that the bruteforcing method works against grsecurity 
	|   systems, when in fact the feature that would prevent any
	|   serious real-world use of such a technique, though discussed,
	|   was conveniently left out of the final testing which was 
	|   only done against the plain PaX patch.  But I skimmed through
	|   it and pretended I understood it, and saw grsecurity 
	|   mentioned and remembered how much I hate whitehats, so I 
	|   decided to mention it for the people who are too intellectually
	|   lazy to read through Phrack themselves and pretend they
	|   understood it, so instead they can skim through my poor
	|   understanding of what was written and then become even more
	|   poorly informed, until the entire industry follows me on
	|   twitter and praises my blog and substitutes their own thinking
	|   for my code-dumping, comment-paraphrasing, brain-dead
	|   understanding and ethics.  Then all us cool scenesters can 
	|   joke on twitter about how we miss spender and that he was a 
	|   good troll, while never contributing anything noteworthy 
	|   ourselves.  Which isn't because we can't produce 
	|   anything worthwhile, no no, it's just because our strong 
	|   underground anti-sec principles keep us from doing it.
	|   Obviously...

xorl's rise to 'fame' came about because people believed he was creating 
in-depth analyses of vulnerabilities, something many would respect due 
to the significant effort needed for attention to the quality and 
accuracy of such analysis.  Except once people actually started reading 
what he was writing, they found that it wasn't that at all -- and yet
he was receiving credit as if it was.  So he's at best completely 
uncommitted to any quality or accuracy in his posts, the errors so 
egregious at times that it's far beyond what simple oversight can 
explain.  At worst he's an intellectual fraud, who would have been 
exposed far earlier by others were it not for the fact that our society 
embraces this brand of faux-intellectualism.  Call this all a troll if 
you want to live in denial, but don't forget that you're merely writing 
(poorly) about the actual work and real contributions of others ;)

Obviously.
