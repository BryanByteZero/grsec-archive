If we're being honest, no one should use something just because 
Snowden recommends it or exhibits some familiarity with it.  I am 
against these kinds of arguments from authority whether they're 
used to promote SELinux by mentioning NSA involvement or even in 
this case of Snowden promoting grsecurity.  If something is to be 
used, it should be evaluated on its technical merits, not because 
(with all due respect) someone whose notoriety came from his 
position and not any technical security prowess recommends it.  For 
this reason I won't be RTing these or similar mentions.
